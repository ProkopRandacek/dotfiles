If it's unnecessary, you can remove it from the toolbar.\n* There are more addons extending usability of TST's sidebar, e.g. a small \"Bookmarks\" sidebar panel below tabs.","weeklyDownloads":4736,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Piro (piro_or)","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/9480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/197/197364.png?modified=1547223933","width":700,"height":406,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/197/197364.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":371,"caption":"Overview"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/209/209754.png?modified=1547223933","width":476,"height":524,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/209/209754.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":436,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Context menu on Firefox 64 and later"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/188/188780.png?modified=1547223933","width":316,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188780.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":289,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Drag and drop to manage tree"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/197/197361.png?modified=1547223933","width":270,"height":259,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/197/197361.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":270,"thumbnailHeight":259,"caption":"Supports container tab"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/197/197363.png?modified=1547223933","width":270,"height":279,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/197/197363.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":270,"thumbnailHeight":279,"caption":"Long-press on the new tab button"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/188/188782.png?modified=1547223933","width":700,"height":327,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/188/188782.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":299,"caption":"Various built-in theme"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/209/209753.png?modified=1547223933","width":342,"height":432,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/209/209753.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":342,"thumbnailHeight":432,"caption":"\"Save bookmark\" dialog"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/209/209755.png?modified=1547223933","width":424,"height":351,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/209/209755.png?modified=1547223933","thumbnailWidth":424,"thumbnailHeight":351,"caption":"Draggable handle on tabs"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3657,"reviewCount":1803,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/reviews/","updateDate":1582291023000},{"id":"jid1-ZAdIEUB7XOzOJw@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/385/385621-32.png?modified=1571235099","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/385/385621-64.png?modified=1571235099","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/385/385621-128.png?modified=1571235099"},"name":"DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials","version":"2019.12.12","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3467553/duckduckgo_privacy_essentials-2019.12.12-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://duckduckgo.com/app","supportURL":null,"description":"Privacy, simplified.

What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn't track you. Ever.\n    Decode Privacy Policies — We’ve partnered with Terms of Service Didn't Read to include their scores and labels of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available. \n\n\nOur add-on also adds a toolbar icon that shows you a Privacy Grade rating when you visit a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how protected you are at a glance, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying site's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.\n\nToo many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet. We're fighting to change that, and have made it our mission to set a new standard of trust online.
